## Week 6:
- Fails of the week
- None
- ### Successes of the week
  - Requirements presentation is done
  - Data files are downloaded and saved for further processing
- ### Difficulties of the week
  - Formatting of the data files and finding datasets within the same timeframe

## Week 7:
- Fails of the week
- None
- ### Successes of the week
- Completed data mapping document covering all the study data
- Reviewed the assets and liabilities composities, which will be used to calculate the current ratio, the main indicator of liquidity
- Organized the time series data into a table with 6 columns detailing the date range, attribute, data type, units, frequencies, information, source, and mapping/notes.This format is a more convenient way to set up environment.
- ### Difficulties of the week
-  Working with asset and liability composites to define actions for the agent has been challenging, especially in mapping each indicator that will impact the agent's decisions
-  Mapping relevant actions precisely to each indicator influencing the agent's behavior is requiring careful planning
-    ### Goals for next week
-    Continue working on the mappings anf prepare all data
-    Load, inspect, normalize and standardize the data
-    Begin drafting the design document
## Week 8:

## Week 11:
- Fails of the week
- My calculations on the new datasets are failing due to encoding issues, as the column names in the datasets are either not being recognized or misinterpreted. This is likely caused by inconsistencies in the character encoding of the files, which prevents proper alignment of column headers with the expected schema during processing. Mismatch in encoding ( UTF-8 vs. mixed data types)
- ### Successes of the week
- New dataset script worked very well for downloading and saving the data
- Other features datasets are validated and the data is mostly cleaned with no missing values
- Completing Competency Demo
- ### Difficulties of the week
- Encoding issues
- Misalignment in the data frequency ( daily vs. quarterly) and finding ways to handle it
- Raw data for the current ratio very sporading, with outliers, skewed
- ### Goals for the next week
- Normalize, standardize the datasets
- Fix the encoding issues and add the missing data
- Work on time series alignment
- Work on design document

## Week 12:
- Fails of the week
- Interpolation of quarterly data to daily data for assets and liabilities 
- ### Successes of the week 
- Found more Asset Liability Management Reinforcement Learning articles for reference
- Created mappings susccessfully of all the  asets and liabilities columns included in the dataframe
- Narrowed the dataset with limited number of institutions to match the 2052 Liquidity daily reporting requirements,i.e. indicating which institutions should submit the liquidity report daily
- Successflully created stasts dataFrame with Coefficient Variance and heurustic to determine the type of the interpolation to daily time series based on the  CV Categorization
- Redownloaded 2014 data files and was able to include them in the raw dataframe
- ### Difficulties of the week
- Interpolation to Daily Buisiness Day from quarterly
- How to handle multiple rows with the same quarterly date to extend to daily , need carefully to select groupping sorting of the dataset
- Determine ways to interpolate - linear, spline, logarithmic
- ### Goals for the next week
- Get the daily time series dataset for assets and liabilities working
- Merge the above dataframe with the other market and economic indicators datasets
- Work on the merged dataset to identify action set and reward functions
- Desing document
